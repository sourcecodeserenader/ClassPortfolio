Corner Grocer Item Tracker Project

Project Summary: The Corner Grocer Item Tracker is a C++ console application designed to help a local grocery store analyze item purchase frequencies. 
By processing a text record of daily transactions, the program helps reorganize the store's layout effectively by highlighting how often items are purchased. 
Key functionalities include searching for specific item frequencies, displaying all items' frequencies, and visualizing this data through a histogram.

Strengths: I excelled at implementing the Map data structure to manage item frequencies efficiently. 
The use of maps enabled quick searches and easy updates, making the feature to look up individual item frequencies robust and responsive. 
Additionally, I applied solid error handling to manage user input, ensuring the program runs smoothly without unexpected crashes due to invalid data.

Areas for Enhancement: In future iterations, the code could be enhanced by integrating a graphical user interface to improve user interaction. 
Incorporating file handling for exportable reports would also make the data more accessible for non-technical staff. 
To increase efficiency, implementing algorithms with better time complexity for data processing could be explored.

Challenges and Solutions: One of the most challenging parts was creating the histogram feature. 
It involved not just logic to count and display frequencies but also formatting the output correctly. 
To overcome this, I leveraged the string manipulation capabilities of C++ and consulted documentation on formatting techniques. 
The tools that proved invaluable included the Visual Studio debugger for tracing and fixing issues and the zyBooks sections on Maps and file I/O for reference.

Transferable Skills: Skills that I honed during this project and that are transferable include:
-Proficiency in using standard libraries in C++.
-The ability to write clean, maintainable code with clear documentation.
-An understanding of how to structure code to handle real-world tasks, like data processing and user input.

Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability: To ensure maintainability and readability, I followed industry best practices by including comprehensive in-line comments and using self-explanatory naming conventions for variables and functions. 
For adaptability, the code was written with modularity in mind, allowing for easy updates and the addition of new features without significant overhauls.
