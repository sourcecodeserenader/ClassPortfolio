## Projects

### Corner Grocer Item Tracker Project (Completed: 04/28/2024)
#### Project Summary
**The Corner Grocer Item Tracker** is a C++ console application designed to help a local grocery store analyze item purchase frequencies. By processing a text record of daily transactions, the program helps reorganize the store's layout effectively by highlighting how often items are purchased. Key functionalities include:

- Searching for specific item frequencies
- Displaying all items' frequencies
- Visualizing this data through a histogram

#### Strengths
I excelled at **implementing the Map data structure** to manage item frequencies efficiently. This enabled quick searches and updates, ensuring robust and responsive functionality. My approach to **error handling** ensured that the program ran smoothly, even when faced with invalid user input.

#### Areas for Enhancement
For future iterations, I consider **integrating a graphical user interface** to improve user interaction. Incorporating **file handling** for exportable reports would make the data more accessible to non-technical staff. Additionally, implementing algorithms with **better time complexity** for data processing is a potential area for code efficiency enhancement.

#### Challenges and Solutions
Creating the histogram feature presented a significant challenge, requiring not just logic to count and display frequencies but also careful attention to output formatting. I overcame this by leveraging **string manipulation capabilities** in C++ and consulting extensive documentation. The **Visual Studio debugger** and **zyBooks** resources were invaluable tools for solving issues related to Maps and file I/O.

#### Transferable Skills
Key skills developed during this project that are transferable to other work include:
- Proficiency in **using standard libraries** in C++.
- Writing **clean, maintainable code** with clear documentation.
- Structuring code to handle **real-world tasks** effectively.

#### Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability
I adhered to **industry best practices** in maintainability and readability by including comprehensive in-line comments and using self-explanatory naming conventions. The code's modular design enhances adaptability, facilitating **easy updates** and the addition of new features without significant overhauls.

### The Gaming Room Software Design Project (Completed: 06/23/2024)
#### Summary of The Gaming Room Client and Software Requirements
The Gaming Room is a client that required a multiplayer gaming application. The software needed to manage user sessions, game states, and leaderboards efficiently.

#### Reflection

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**
I provided detailed diagrams and flowcharts that clearly explained the architecture and workflow of the application.

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**
The design document served as a roadmap, which made the coding process more straightforward by having a clear structure and requirements outlined.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
I would revise the user interface design section to include more detailed wireframes and user interaction flows.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
I gathered user requirements through client meetings and feedback. This ensured the design was user-centric, improving usability and satisfaction.

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**
I used agile methodologies and iterative design processes. In the future, I would continue to use user stories and regular feedback loops to refine the design.
