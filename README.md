## Corner Grocer Item Tracker Project

### Project Summary

**The Corner Grocer Item Tracker** is a C++ console application designed to help a local grocery store analyze item purchase frequencies. By processing a text record of daily transactions, the program helps reorganize the store's layout effectively by highlighting how often items are purchased. Key functionalities include:

- Searching for specific item frequencies
- Displaying all items' frequencies
- Visualizing this data through a histogram

### Strengths

I excelled at **implementing the Map data structure** to manage item frequencies efficiently. This enabled quick searches and updates, ensuring robust and responsive functionality. My approach to **error handling** ensured that the program ran smoothly, even when faced with invalid user input.

### Areas for Enhancement

For future iterations, I consider **integrating a graphical user interface** to improve user interaction. Incorporating **file handling** for exportable reports would make the data more accessible to non-technical staff. Additionally, implementing algorithms with **better time complexity** for data processing is a potential area for code efficiency enhancement.

### Challenges and Solutions

Creating the histogram feature presented a significant challenge, requiring not just logic to count and display frequencies but also careful attention to output formatting. I overcame this by leveraging **string manipulation capabilities** in C++ and consulting extensive documentation. The **Visual Studio debugger** and **zyBooks** resources were invaluable tools for solving issues related to Maps and file I/O.

### Transferable Skills

Key skills developed during this project that are transferable to other work include:

- Proficiency in **using standard libraries** in C++.
- Writing **clean, maintainable code** with clear documentation.
- Structuring code to handle **real-world tasks** effectively.

### Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability

I adhered to **industry best practices** in maintainability and readability by including comprehensive in-line comments and using self-explanatory naming conventions. The code's modular design enhances adaptability, facilitating **easy updates** and the addition of new features without significant overhauls.
